    "## Situated Projective Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Situated Projective Simulation is a model of epsidic memory. The central goal of the model is to understand how the \"clips\" of an ECM become encoded, such that a graph structure supporting Projective Simulation emerges. A central hypothesis of the model is that agents use encodings of past events to perform **recursive state estimation** with a **Bayesian Filter**. The \"actions\" of a SiPS ECM are predictions - they may apply to sensory states or to active states of an agent, for example by treating some predictions as \"action predictions\", as with the priming ECM detailed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section develops the ECM of a Situated Projective Simulation agent in parts. Each part builds upon the last. First, the core mechanism of a recursive state estimation with a Bayesian filter is introduced. This ECM handles the case where a Hidden Markov Model of the environment is already known. Then, a simple \"sequence filter\" is introduced, which uses a remembered sequence of past percepts, rather than a known HMM, as the basis for recursive state estimation with the Bayesian Filter. Third, a \"short-term episodic memory\" is introduced, in which the memory of encoded percept sequences \"fades\" - allowing generalization of past sequences to new sequences based on similarity. Fourth, a \"long-term episodic memory\" is introduced, which inhibits the fading of memories as a function of surprise at time of encoding and the strengh of future re-activations. The predictions of such memories are also modified at moments of re-activation, allowing them to morph into more generalized, semantic knowledge of then envionment's properties.\n",
