    "Here we will build the new repo release of Projective Simulation. To do so, we will use [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). I tried to simplify as much as possible this repo in order to facilitate your contributions. If you found this text, it means that you reached the github repo. Next step is to clone it. Then go to the cloned folder and run:\n",
