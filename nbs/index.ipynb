    "Here we will build the new repo release of Projective Simulation. To do so, we will use [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). I tried to simplify as much as possible this repo in order to facilitate your contributions. If you found this text, it means that you reached the github repo. Next step is to FORK! the repo (see contributing below) and the clone your fork. Then go to the cloned folder and run:\n",

    "## Building the package\n",

    "I added `nbdev` to the requirements, so you are now ready to add your contributions to the PS library! To learn how, go to the two notebooks you will find in  `nbs/lib_nbs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Webpage documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation will directly be constructed from the notebooks you generated. As the repo is currently private, you can only check it locally. To do so, use the terminal to run:\n",

    "```\n",
    "nbdev_preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate the current version of the docs in the port `4200`. Go and check how that correlates to the notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside of the documentation, it is also nice to give prospective users some tutorials to understand how the different tools work. You can include them in `nbs/tutorials`!\n",

    "# Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a template of what we want to build. In order to contribute, used your fork to do Pull Requests to the main branch. Before merging your contributions, be sure to clean your notebooks from unnecessary metadata. This is done by running `nbdev_clean` in the terminal before you commit your changes!\n"
