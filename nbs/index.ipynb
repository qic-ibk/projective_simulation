    "Projective Simulation (PS) is a framework for studying agency from a physical perspective. PS agents learn from interaction with their environment and base their decisions on **episodic memory**. Internally, their deliberation corresponds to **random walks on a clip network (graph)**, which provides an interpretable route to physical realizations and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This library provides all the necessary tools to develop, deploy, and train PS agents in a variety of environments. Its content ranges from entry-level [tutorials](tutorials/index_tutorials.ipynb) introducing the core principles of PS to cutting-edge [research](webpage/research.ipynb) on the latest developments and applications. It is actively developed by the [QIC group at UIBK](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/th-physik/qic-group/).\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Projective simulation is available for ```python>=3.10``` via\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install projective_simulation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also install all required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To begin exploring Projective Simulation, we recommend to start with the [tutorials](tutorials/index_tutorials.ipynb), which cover everything from the basics to more advanced applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to develop or deploy PS agents, please refer to the [documetation](lib_nbs/index_docs.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "If you want to contribute to this library, please take a look at the [contributing tutorial](tutorials/contributing/00_contributing.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citing\n",
    "If you find this package useful in your projects, you can either cite the specific PS paper most relevant to your work (see a list [here](figs/PS_mindmap.html)) or use the following to cite the library as a whole:"
