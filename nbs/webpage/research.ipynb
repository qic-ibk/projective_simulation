    "- [“Run-and-Tumble Particles Learning Chemotaxis”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23519) by *N. Tovazzi, G. Muñoz-Gil and *M. Caraglio* (2025). In this work we explore the ability of active particles to adapt their run-and-tumble strategy to reach targets, based on their chemotactic response, just as bacteria do in the real world!\n",

Kaur, L. Fiderer, A. López-Incera, H. J. Briegel, T. Franosch*, and *G. Muñoz-Gil* (2024). In this case, we study the ability of agents to learn how to switch from passive to active diffusion to enhance their target search efficiency.\n",
