    "These tutorials are designed to introduce the fundamentals of PS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Intro to PS](learning_ps/00_Introduction_to_PS.ipynb): This notebook guides you through the basics of a PS agent equipped with a two-layer ECM. You will learn how the agent updates its internal structure based on reinforcement learning.\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "Here you will find tutorials illustrating the use of PS in various applications, often developed within scientific papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Learning to reset in target search problems](applications/foraging/02_learning_to_reset.ipynb): This notebook explores how a PS agent can learn an efficient resetting strategy for searching randomly distributed targets.\n",
